# Module 3: Remote Repositories - Overview and Reading
Everything you've done so far has been done entirely on one computer (or one computer cluster in the case of hills). In this module, you'll see how to distribute a repository between one central location and one or more peripheral locations.

Most of the time, when you use git, you'll be making changes on your __local__ machine, which has a __local__ copy of a repository. Every so often, you'll send changes to (or receive changes from) the __remote__ repository, which is stored at a central location which everyone on your team has access to. In this class, our remote repositories will be stored on a website called GitHub.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

1.  Make a copy of a remote repository on your local machine
2.  Ask for changes from a remote repository
3.  Send changes to a remote repository


## Reading
Read sections 4.1 and 5.2 from [Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial)

Read the following pages on the Atlassian git tutorial:
[Git Remote](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)
[Git Fetch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch)
[Git Push](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push)
[Git Pull](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull)

Note that we haven't yet learned about branches, so when the reading mentions having multiple branches, don't worry too much about it.
