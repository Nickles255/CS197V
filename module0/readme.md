# Module 0: Linux CommandLne - Overview and Reading
In this module, you will learn how to log into the __hills computer cluster__ here at CCSF. Hills uses the __Linux__ operating system, so you'll also need to learn some basic __Linux commands__. You'll also need to learn how to create, edit, and save files using the __nano text editor__.

## Learning Outcome
By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

1.  Write commands to navigate a Linux file system and view its contents.
2.  Write commands to add, copy, move, and remove files and directories.
3.  Use Linux programs to examine and edit text files.

## Reading
First, read the course page called [Reference: Logging Into Hills](https://ccsf.instructure.com/courses/24952/pages/reference-logging-into-hills), along with the [ACRC hills guide](http://www.ccsf.edu/Services/ACRC/HANDOUTS/HLS/1_Login_out.pdf). 

Then, read the Introduction, Tutorial One, and Tutorial Two from [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/).

Finally, read [The Beginner's Guide to Nano, the Linux Command-Line Text Editor](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/).

You might also find the ACRC [nano Editor](http://www.ccsf.edu/Services/ACRC/HANDOUTS/HLS/nano_Editor.pdf) handout to be a useful reference.

## Optional Reading
To get a more thorough introduction to the Linux command line, consider reading [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial). It's long, but it contains information that you'll need sooner or later as a software developer. Even if you are comfortable at the Linux command line, this is probably a good review!
